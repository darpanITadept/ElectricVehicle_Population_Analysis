## Project Overview

This project analyzes electric vehicles data using both Python (pandas) and SQL. The dataset includes information about various electric vehicle models, their specifications, and eligibility for clean alternative fuel. The analysis covers a range of insights, including total base MSRP, average electric range, and eligibility percentages based on different criteria.

## Project Structure

### Python (Jupyter Notebook)

- **Notebook:** [EV_Vehicle_Analysis.ipynb]
  - Loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
  - Performs data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Calculates various statistics such as total base MSRP and average electric range.
  - Identifies models with the highest total base MSRP and average electric range.
  - Analyzes county eligibility percentages and legislative districts with the highest average electric range.
  - Identifies models and makes with low battery range but high base MSRP.

### SQL Queries

- **SQL Files:** [EV_Vehicle_Analysis.sql]
  - Contains SQL queries for various analyses, including counting unique models, filtering based on eligibility, calculating averages, and identifying top models.
